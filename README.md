IMPORTANT THINGS I LEARNED:
Start with mobile development first and work towards desktop resolution with media queries. I messed up my first portfolio by starting at desktop and it was too challenging and time-wasting to scale everything back to mobile-size. I also wasn't thrilled about how it looked but it looked decent and was good practice. Tailwind is so much better than vanilla css.
